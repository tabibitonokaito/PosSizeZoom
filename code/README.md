# PosSizeZoom

I'm sharing this code because I want to get feedback since those the first things I
try to program seriously. 

At start I had a lot of classes but after some feedback I reduced them a lot.

## changes 20231119
Remodelation of everything, PosSizeZoom doesn't exist anymore and we're
we start almost everything from the beggining.


## classes
- Vec2: basic vector class
- Zoom: basic zoom holder class

## files 
- psz_limits.h includes some functions that helps to hold Vector and Zoom in certain ranges 
(check .h for more details)
